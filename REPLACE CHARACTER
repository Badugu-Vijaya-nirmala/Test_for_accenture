Write a function Replacecharacter(Char str1, Char ch1, Int 1, Char ch2) which has a string(str) and the two 
characters ch1 and ch2. Execute a function in such a way that string str will return to its original string, and all 
the events in ch1 are replaced by ch2 and vice versa? Consider: The strings will have only alphabets in lower 
case.  
 
Sample Test Case:  
Input:  
str: tervpro  
ch1: e  
ch2: p  
 
Output:  
tprvero  
 
Solution:  
All the ‘e’s in the string are replaced with the ‘p’ and ‘p’ is replaced with the ‘e’. 

program:
def replace_character(str,c1,c2):
  str=str.replace(c1,'#')
  str=str.replace(c2,c1)
  str=str.replace('#',c2)
  return str
str=input()
c1=input()
c2=input()
print(replace_character(str,c1,c2))
